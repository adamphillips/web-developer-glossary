All of the glossary content is stored in the repository so to contribute
content, simply send a pull request with your changes.

Content is stored as markdown files in `content/glossary`. Terms are defined in
[content/definitions.rb](https://github.com/adamphillips/web-developer-glossary/blob/master/content/definitions.rb)
using a simple DSL.  The best place to look for reference on the DSL is
[classes/glossary/term/dsl_parser.rb](https://github.com/adamphillips/web-developer-glossary/blob/master/classes/glossary/term/dsl_parser.rb).

DNS stands for Domain Name System.  When we talk about websites, we
usually refer to them by their domain name, for example facebook.com,
twitter.com etc. Computers connected in a network, like the internet refer to
each other in terms of ip addresses, eg 173.252.110.27, 199.16.156.230.

DNS is the mechanism that converts human-friendly domain names into
machine-friendly ip addresses.
